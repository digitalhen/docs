## API Keys

The Transcord API uses API keys for authentication. Include your key in the `Authorization` header with every request.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer tr_live_your_api_key
```

### Getting an API Key

1. Log in to your [Transcord account](https://app.transcord.app/login)
2. Go to [Settings](https://app.transcord.app/settings)
3. Scroll to "API Access" and click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy your key immediately - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
  API access requires a **Pro** or **Business** subscription.
</Warning>

### API Key Format

All Transcord API keys start with `tr_live_` followed by a random string:

```
tr_live_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ12
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.transcord.app/api/v1/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tr_live_your_api_key"
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose keys in client-side code">
    API keys should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in JavaScript that runs in the browser, mobile apps, or any code that users can inspect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, not in your source code:

    ```bash .env
    TRANSCORD_API_KEY=tr_live_your_api_key
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.TRANSCORD_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Generate a new API key periodically and update your applications. This limits the impact if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revoke compromised keys immediately">
    If you suspect your API key has been exposed, revoke it immediately in [Settings](https://app.transcord.app/settings) and generate a new one.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

API requests are limited to **100 requests per minute** per API key.

If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests."
}
```

## OAuth 2.0 (MCP Integration)

For MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations with Claude AI, Transcord supports OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. This allows Claude to access your recordings on your behalf.

See the [MCP Integration guide](/guides/mcp-integration) for setup instructions.

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Your API key is missing, invalid, or has been revoked.

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Check that you're including the `Authorization` header
- Verify your API key is correct (starts with `tr_live_`)
- Generate a new key if yours was revoked

### 403 Forbidden

Your API key is valid but you don't have access to the requested resource.

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're accessing your own recordings
- Check that your subscription is active
